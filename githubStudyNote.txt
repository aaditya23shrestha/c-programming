Github provides us a repository where we can add our code and let others view and contribute.
 
To Host our code in github, we must

Create a repo in github
Then initialize git in our local machine with command
- git init 
now git is ready in out local machine, we can rename the default branch to main or leave it as master
- git branch -m master main
Now connect remote and local git repo
- git remote add origin https://github.com/aaditya23shrestha/c-programming.git
Now create .gitignore file and add the files which don't need to be in github repo
Add files using
-git add <filename>
- git add .  (. adds all the files)
or you can choose which file to add from vscode source control
You can always check status with
- git status
Now commit all your changes with proper message
- git commit -m "What work did"
Finally push all your changes
- git push origin main
